# Project Proposal

## *Project Title*

#### Enhancing User Experience: Comprehensive Testing Strategies for a Robust To-Do Application

## *Objectives*  

##### The objective of this project is to develop a To-Do application prototype and apply software testing techniques to ensure its reliability and robustness. The project aims to achieve the following goals:
- fullfill the requirements of the DEPI 2 training.
- imporove teamwork skills.
- apply software testing techniques to a real-world project.

## *Motivation*  

##### This project is motivated by the goal of ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience in a To-Do application through comprehensive software testing, bridging theory and practice to deliver a high-quality productivity tool.

## *Prototype Description*  

##### The prototype is a lightweight, user-friendly To-Do application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. 
### It includes core features such as task creation, editing, deletion, and completion. The interface is intuitive, with a clean design for easy navigation. 
### The prototype will be developed using Nextjs, mongoDb, Prisma, NextAuth, Docker and Github actions as CI/CD pipeline and will serve as the foundation for applying various software testing techniques, including functional, usability, and performance testing, to ensure robustness and reliability.

## *Project Plan*  

##### *1. Planning*  
- Define goals, scope, and testing strategies.  
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Allocate resources (tools, technologies, team roles).  
- Create a timeline with milestones.  
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies.  

##### *2. Design*  
- Design system architecture (front-end, back-end, database).  
- Create wireframes and UI/UX mockups.  
- Define core features (task creation, editing, completion).  
- Develop a test plan with cases and methodologies.  

##### *3. Implementation*  
- Develop front-end Nextjs.  
- Implement back-end (Nextjs, Prisma, Nodejs) and database (MongoDB).  
- Integrate core features (task management, authentication).  

##### *4. Testing and Evaluation*  
- Conduct functional, usability, and performance testing.  
- Identify and fix bugs or issues.  
- Evaluate app performance against requirements.  
- Finalize and document testing results.
